## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'digital ghost'—a persistent, emotional data-echo of a deceased person in an unexpected place (a traffic system, an appliance, a forgotten game server). How do they interact with it?
- Create a memory-tagging system for a future society. What poetic, non-literal phrases (like 'the stillness at the end of the song') do people use to categorize their lived experiences? Write a user's log.
- Imagine a 'context farmer' like Kazuo in a different setting (a desert, a library, a forest). What signals do they harvest, and what is their 'cathedral' made of?
- Write a dialogue between a 'preserver' (like Leo) and a 'narrative engineer' (like Anya) arguing over the best way to save a dying tradition: through perfect archival or through adapting it into a new story.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative data-storage medium for preserving 'aura' or 'context' alongside digital artifacts. What would its technical specs and limitations be?
- Build a simple sentiment-analysis tool that scans text for recurring, unique poetic phrases (like the novel's motif) instead of standard keywords, to find emerging 'glitches' in human expression.
